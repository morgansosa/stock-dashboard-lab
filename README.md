# Stock Data Project (a.k.a. yikes)

This project was assigned through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It was supposed to teach scraping, API usage, and plotting in Python.

### What it *actually* did:
- Made me run prewritten code I didn’t write or understand
- Broke multiple times due to missing dependencies (shoutout to `lxml`)
- Buried key instructions in collapsed menus and vague “optional” tips
- Told me to "extract a table" but didn’t teach how to identify the right one
- Gave a graphing function and said "don't worry about how it works," then graded me on how it looked

> 💡 **This repo exists because I needed to finish the course, not because this project was well-designed.**

## Tools I had to wrestle into submission:
- `yfinance` (actually nice)
- `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` (which they used poorly)
- `plotly` (which they used as a black box)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## What I actually learned:
- That I should build my own data science projects from scratch because I am more qualified than whoever wrote this lab, and that no one who was involved in writing the lab actually tested it. 
- Data science is about problem solving and curiosity—not just stringing together tools like BeautifulSoup and yfinance. But this lab, and everything in this whole series of courses, avoids every messy, interesting part of the process in favor of scripted commands and sanitized outcomes. It teaches which buttons to press, but never how to think like a data scientist.
